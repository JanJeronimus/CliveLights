PCB for "Big Clive Computer" (blinking lights)

With blinking Leds a display effect of an 'old computer' can be created also know als "Big Clive Computer"
On the back of the PCB for each Led an SMD resistor can be added. 
However if all the same LEDs are used these resistors also can be replaced by solder bridges (or zero ohm resistors)
