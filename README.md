PCB for "Big Clive Computer" (blinking lights)

With blinking Leds a display effect of an 'old computer' can be created also know als "Big Clive Computer"
PCB is 10 cm  x 10 cm having 7 rows x 7 columns with leds
Also two holes for power connections (dupont connector) and some holes for mounting of the PCB are provided.

On the back of the PCB for each Led an SMD resistor can be added. 
If all the same LEDs are used these resistors also can be replaced by solder bridges (or zero ohm resistors)

The amount of LEDs in the Schematic does not equal the amount of LEDs on the PCB as the schematic also can be used for PCB designs with more LEDs.
